Food Trends 2023 This article provides an overview of food trends suggested by top industry associations and organizations and those that appear in several other reputable lists. Save for later Print Share Updated: March 30, 2023 Skip to the end of the images gallery Credit: Edgar Castrejon (unsplash) Skip to the beginning of the images gallery Food trends develop based on many factors, with the process best summed up as \"inexact science, a blend of research, intuition, wishful thinking, and cribbed retailer data\" (The Guardian, 2021). What professional chefs then adopt for their menus (Datassential, n.d.) appears on our friends, family, and influencers' social media posts, is highlighted on cooking shows and reality cooking competitions and is included in food and alcohol-focused magazines and websites. In addition to those with direct access to consumers, growers, and manufacturers are also crucial in the discussion, as they supply the ready-to-consume foods and ingredients for value-added processed products sold through retail.\n",
      "Food Trends Matter\n",
      "Furthermore, our time to prepare meals, cultural flavors, our perceptions of the environment, and our actions regarding the availability of renewable and non-renewable resources greatly influences our eating behaviors and attitudes. Nevertheless, most consumers are impacted by these forces when seeking something \"new\" to eat. In addition, the macroeconomic conditions in the United States and internationally will shape consumer shopping behaviors for food in 2023. Employment levels, interest rates, inflation, and, following, consumer confidence all affect how people feel about their spending power and what kinds of food they will buy.\n",
      "Plant-forward eating, plant-based proteins, and plant-based foods\n",
      "Overall, consumer interest in including more produce in their diet is increasing. Of those surveyed, 57% would like to increase their fruit and vegetable consumption, which is a 10% increase over responses collected in 2021 (Datassentials, 2022). \n",
      "The \"plant-forward\" eating style has recently been defined as \"[a] style of cooking and eating that emphasizes and celebrates, but is not limited to, foods from plant sources—fruits and vegetables (produce), whole grains, legumes (pulses), nuts and seeds, plant oils, and herbs and spices—and reflects evidence-based principles of health and sustainability.\" (CIA, 2020) A more direct explanation is: \"If there is protein, the first priority is a plant-based protein. If there is an animal-based protein, it is not at the center of the plate, but rather a contributor to the plate.\" (Yale, 2020). Consumers choose to follow the plant-based eating style for many reasons, such as lowering the risk of a particular disease and health conditions and environmental concerns (SEAG, n.d.).\n",
      "Plant-based proteins, such as grains, lentils, and garbanzo beans, are becoming increasingly popular among consumers due to their high nutritional content and affordability. Plant-based protein sources include lesser-known food ingredients such as pea protein, algae, fungus-based proteins, and seitan (made from wheat gluten). As more people look for ways to reduce their meat consumption, plant-based proteins will likely become even more mainstream in the years ahead. The main reasons why consumers aged 18 and older ate plant-based proteins included being a good source of protein (18% of responses). With a 1/3 cup of white wheat pasta having 3 grams of protein and the same amount of quinoa having 6 grams, simple substitutes like this can help someone on a 2,000-calorie meet their daily protein needs (50-175 grams of protein/10-35% of calories) (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Consumers interested in increasing the protein content of the snacks they consume can easily find high-protein tortilla chips with 19 grams of protein per serving (see Questnutrition.com).\n",
      "Other reasons consumers aged 18 and older ate plant-based proteins were to add variety to their diet (16%); they were perceived as being healthier than meat (14%); they enjoy the taste (13%); good value (10%); and animal welfare reason, being better than for the environment than meat, and the family enjoys the products, all of which were each selected by 6% of survey participants (Mintel, plant-based Proteins – U.S.- 2022, paywall).\n",
      "While 61% of consumers consider themselves omnivores, 29% of consumers belong to one of the four \"meat limiter\" segments: flexitarians (occasionally eat animal-based products), pescatarians (consumes fish but not meat and poultry), vegetarians (do not eat meat, poultry, fish, or seafood), and vegans (excludes all animal products including dairy and eggs) (Datassentials, 2022). Other research indicates that an even more significant proportion, 1/3, of U.S. consumers consider themselves flexitarians. It is this consumer group who are the primary target for plant-based products, along with Millennials (born between 1980 and 1995), Gen Z (born between 1996 and 2010), parents of Generation Alpha (children born since 2010), and Asians (GFI, 2023)\n",
      "What is plant-based food?: \"any food product made with 100% plants is a plant-based food. Plant-based foods are made from plants, such as chickpea-based chicken nuggets or pea-protein burgers made entirely of plants. Other examples are  nut milks and soy products. It also includes produce in any form (fresh, canned, frozen, etc.)\" PGH (n.d.). According to the Hartman Group, 2021, 48% of consumers indicate that they look for products labeled \"plant-based,\" (Hartman Group, 2021) and 31% seek out plant-based proteins to include in their diets. What some readers may want to know is: \"What has been the interest and response to plant-based meat substitutes?\" According to Datassential, 71% \"of Americans have tried a plant-based burger or other meat alternatives\", and 40% of consumers say that they plan to purchase plant-based meat substitutes in 2023 (Datassential, 2022) While there has been a certain level of acceptance, there are perceived barriers that influence consumers not to buy or consume the products, such as the product's taste, flavor, or texture, that plant-based meats are not as nutritious or filling as animal meats, that plant-based meats are more expensive than the comparable animal-meats (Mintel, plant-based Proteins – U.S.- 2022, paywall), and that they are \"too processed.\"  One of the plant-based trends that should be more prevalent is that clean ingredients \"will be the new standard, as plant-based products shift from being a novelty, which people purchase initially for the type, to a health food item\" (Garwood, 2022).\n",
      "Sustainability\n",
      "Aside from health benefits, environmental concerns drive plant-based products and produce consumption (Datassentials, 2022). Along with interest in flavors and ingredients, consumers also care about how products are made and their packaging choices. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of food waste and are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their own waste. According to a study conducted by HealthFocus (Nunes, 2022), the top five environmental concerns that are important to consumers are a) plastic waste, b) pollution, c) chemicals in the food supply, d) climate change, and e) food waste. Sources indicate that \"over 30% of all food produced globally is lost or goes to waste\" and that 95% of consumers want to \"do their part\" to prevent this, with 60% willing \"to buy more upcycled food products\" (see Upcycledfood.org) Items include a) gluten-free okara four, which \"is a low-car, keto-friendly flour made from the pulp leftover from soymilk processing,\" (see: Renewal Mill Gluten Free Baking Flour) b) snacks made from fruit rinds, (for example, Rindsnacks) c) pasta made with upcycled barley, wheat, and rye, (for example Regrained) and d) vodka made with beer that does not meet quality expectations or is made from \"excess bake goods.\" (see Misadventure Vodka).\n",
      "While there are several websites and mobile apps that a) help consumers learn about a food's shelf life, (see the USDA, FDA FoodKeeper app) b) allow consumers to track and manage foods in their pantries (see No Waste app), c) provide a platform for neighbors to share food that might go to waste (see Olio app), or d) even find food retailers in their area with discounted items nearing their expiration date (see Flash app), small agricultural businesses can easily provide such information in newsletters, on social media platforms, and in messages with pick-up instructions that they send to community supported agriculture members. \n",
      "Aside from an interest in what ingredients are in the foods they eat, consumers \"will look for companies to be transparent about the impacts of their products, packaging, [and] transportation\" (Supermarket News, 2022). While less of a factor than price, brand, quality perception, and convenient access, product packaging accounted for 20% of a consumer's fresh fruit and vegetable and 24% of packaged food purchasing decisions (McKinsey & Company). Trend Hunter (2022) notes in their 2023 Trend Report that sustainable packing, packaging that is \"easily recyclable, or even compostable\" to eco-friendly plant-based food coatings, which \"could replace plastic packaging,\" is one way that businesses can meet consumer need to \"reduce their personal impact\" on the environment. Other Steps that food industry members can take to become sustainable include using compostable adhesives and educating consumers about properly recycling materials. \n",
      "A survey conducted in 2021 indicated that over half of U.S. consumers were willing to pay extra for a \"sustainable version of products\" and that willingness to \"switch brands/products for sustainability reasons\" was highest among Gen Z consumers (18-24-year-olds), 64% willing to do so, and Millennials (25-39-year-olds), 65% were willing, compared to Gen X (40-60-year-olds), 57%, and Boomers (over 60 years of age), 39%.  Other research confirms these findings and indicates that a greater percentage of the two younger generations are \"probably willing\" or \"definitely willing\" to pay more for \"greater sustainability\" (see c.o.nxt).\n",
      "Flavors\n",
      "\"Extreme flavors of all kinds are booming right now. Consumers are not only tolerating bolder flavors, like spice and sour, but they expect it\" (Davidson, 2022). According to Mintel (2021), 27% of consumers \"go out of [their] way to try new flavors,\" and 54% \"sometimes try new flavors.\" When segmented by gender, 30 and 24% of men and women, respectively, \"go out of [their] way,\" and 51% of men and 57% of women \"sometimes\" seek new flavors. While 24% of participants between 18 and 24 years of age \"go out of [their] way to try new flavors,\" even more 25-to 34-year-olds (42%) and 35-to-44-year-olds (40%) do so. Thus, it is best for a food industry member to find new and exciting flavors to attract consumer attention.\n",
      "A report published by Yelp indicated that online searches for pickle-flavored foods \"were up 55%\" in 2022 (Yelp.com, 2022). Pickled flavors can offer a unique twist to traditional food items. Pickles, kimchi, miso, beet kvass, beer, and kombucha are some of the \"sour and umami flavors\" that Food Technology Magazine (2022) indicated will be prevalent. Others include tempeh, sauerkraut, and seaweed. Also, expect to see a greater interest in chilies from other continents (e.g., Peruvian pepper, rocoto pepper, espelette pepper) and foods made with chilis, such as chaat masala, a North India spice blend, enter the marketplace in 2023 (Spoonshot, 2022). Other trending cuisines include Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Singapore, Philippines), the Caribbean (Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic), and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile) (Berry, 2022).\n",
      "Ancient grains\n",
      "What exactly is an ancient grain? An ancient grain is a \"grain that has been largely unchanged during the past several hundred years\" (Bricher, 2022). Some of the benefits of ancient grains include being high in protein and fiber and containing essential vitamins and minerals. These grains are a great option for people who want to diversify their diet without compromising taste (Gelski, 2022). Grains can be milled and used as wheat-based flour substitutes (e.g., rye, buckwheat, teff, millet, sorghum), served in place of white rice or pasta (e.g., sorghum, millet, farro, quinoa), and ingredients in soups, stews, or salads (e.g., kamut, freekeh, barley)\n",
      "Ancient grains that, according to research conducted by Arden Mills (2021), at least 86% of U.S. consumers were at least \"somewhat familiar\" with include pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, flax seeds, buckwheat, chia seeds, and quinoa. Slightly fewer, but more than half of those surveyed, were at least \"somewhat familiar\" with sorghum and millet. Millet is poised to be an important food in 2023, as the United Nations has dubbed 2023 the \"International Year of Millet\" (Gelski, 2022). \n",
      "Grains that fewer survey participants were \"somewhat\" or \"very familiar\" with (Ardent Mills, 2021), along with their uses\n",

      "Uses\n",

      "Flour is used in pasta and bread\n",
      "Amaranth\n",
      "30%\n",

      "White Sonora\n",

      "Oldest American wheat; used to make tortillas\n",
      "Teff\n",
      "12%\n",
      "Gluten-free; flour is used to make injera, an Ethiopian flatbread\n",
      "Sources: Ardent Mills (2021). Consumers Healthy Eating/Ancient Grains; breadtopia.com; webmd.com; sorghumcheckoff.com\n",
      "One factor that influenced consumer interest in ancient grains is that some (e.g., amaranth, fonio, millet, sorghum, and teff), but not all, are gluten-free. Among consumers aged 18 and older who bought rice/rice dishes within the previous three months. Seventy-two percent of those surveyed indicated that brown rice is healthier than white rice, and 66% responded that \"blends of rice and ancient grains are a healthier alternative to plain rice\" (Mintel, 2021). Products made with ancient grains may be perceived as premium offerings or providing more benefits than those made with more mainstream ingredients, as 66% of shoppers are \"willing to pay more for products made with ancient grains.\" Circling back to other trends discussed in this article, the protein and fiber content for a 2-ounce serving of chickpea pasta is 11 grams and 8 grams, respectively, 13 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber for red lentil pasta, compared to 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber for white pasta (Mintel, 2021).\n",
      "Alternative Sweeteners\n",
      "The trend of healthier sweeteners has grown recently, with consumers looking for alternatives to traditional sugar and high fructose corn syrup. Natural sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup, and agave nectar have become staples in both restaurants and grocery stores. Consumers are increasingly looking for ingredients that are \"better for you,\" and there is also a trend toward \"clean label sugar substitutes\" (Reilly, 2022).  Some examples are coconut nectar, coconut sugar, fruit juices, and monk fruit.\n",

      "When you think of online video, chances are you think of YouTube. Statista projects it’ll have 2.9 billion users by 2025.\n",
      "So, naturally, when businesses add video content to their marketing strategies, they often host their videos on the platform.\n",
      "If you plan on joining those marketers, what kinds of videos should you make to promote your organization? We asked 26 business YouTube channel owners and tapped into our own expertise to provide 15 examples to inspire you.\n",
      "Out of those 26 respondents, 11 were agencies or consultants, 10 provided business-to-consumer (B2C) products, and five offered business-to-business (B2B) products.\n",
      "For further context, the majority of respondents — 18 — post to their channels weekly, making them frequent users.\n",
      "The survey pool also specializes in a wide range of video genres, with education, explainer, and product demo videos being the most popular.\n",
      "Onto 15 popular types of YouTube videos for your business to try, including those highlighted by respondents and some we suggest ourselves:\n",
      "Video Tutorials\n",
      "Ask Me Anything (AMA) Videos\n",
      "Educational Videos\n",
      "Explainer Videos\n",
      "Product Reviews\n",

      "Community-Based Videos\n",
      "Reaction Videos\n",
      "1. Video Tutorials\n",
      "Video tutorials teach viewers how to perform an action. Businesses often create tutorials related to their products or niches. This video format helps you establish your authority in your industry, build trust with customers, and connect back to your product.\n",
      "At Royal Locks Curl Care, Casey Simmons uses tutorial videos to demonstrate products and connect with the curly hair community. “The curly-haired community is seeking videos in a tutorial format that show product application demos (i.e. ‘before’ hair, product application/use, and ‘after/finished’ results) and reviews on the same hair texture and curls that they have. Often, people come to our YouTube channel to solve a problem they are experiencing with their hair,” Simmons explains.\n",
      "Simmons continues, “For example, they have been straightening their hair for years and want to stop and begin caring for and styling, their hair naturally curly. They don’t know where to begin and seek YouTube to show them demonstrations of products and the benefits they are seeking. These benefits range from dry and damaged hair that needs repair, wanting to protect the hair, cleansing and conditioning to add nourishment, adding volume, getting a great shape or definition and holding it, or reducing frizz.”\n",
      "“Visiting our YouTube channel also provides support and engagement within the curly-haired community. If a viewer is having a hard time getting the curls they want, they can get ideas from others and apply it to their own life. Curly hair isn’t just about the products, it is a lifestyle. The community celebrates the outward expression of a unique inner personality that is curly hair,” Simmons adds.\n",
      "At Databox, we often use tutorials to explain how to use our product, such as in our How to Build a Great SEO Client Dashboard blog post. You can watch the connected YouTube video here.\n",
      "Tip: Wondering what resources you need to start making YouTube videos for your marketing? Check out our guide to video gear and tools.\n",
      "2. Ask Me Anything (AMA) Videos\n",
      "In an ask me anything (AMA) video, an audience asks a subject matter expert questions about hot topics and their process.\n",
      "This format lends itself well to YouTube Live, YouTube’s live streaming format. Your viewers can ask questions in chat, and the subject matter expert can answer them in real time. Then, once your stream is over, YouTube will archive the stream as a video people can watch at any time.\n",
      "If you have a well-established audience, the AMA genre lets you connect with that community and build authority with them. AMA streams and videos tend to be laid-back because of the interactive nature of the content.\n",
      "If you host your own AMA stream, consider having a whiteboard available so your subject matter expert can explain ideas more effectively. You can see how this works in The Futur’s AMA with Chris Do.\n",
      "3. Educational Videos\n",
      "Educational videos include a broad range of subgenres, including tutorials, explainers, and related videos. They educate viewers and improve your authority with them as a result.\n",
      "This type of video was the most popular among our survey participants, and they had a lot to say about them.\n",
      "Alex Cascio from Vibrant Media Productions notices a lot of performance from short, one to three-minute-long educational videos. “These can be trending topics or industry-specific, but if properly put together with clear messaging, captions/titling, and at least decent quality will help maintain viewership and perform well. We create all different types of videos, but ones that are short/educational have grown the best organically. Even if it’s a competing that has a decent amount of views on it for it, you can typically outrank them if you properly fill out your titling, thumbnail, tags, and video detail,” Cascio says.\n",
      "Jeff Moriarty of Moriarty’s Gem Art also finds success with educational videos. “Educational videos result in the most views, the most likes, and the most engagement for our business. They are also the ones that have taken off virally on Reddit the most often, resulting in huge spikes in followers and views,” Moriarty explains.\n",
      "At Online Optimism, many of the high performing videos are educational in nature, according to Jordan Figueredo. “These videos go beyond what we are doing as a company and are more big-picture trends, steps, guides, answers, etc., which resonates very well with our viewers,” Figueredo says.\n",
      "We also rely a lot on educational videos at Databox. One educational video series we have is Data Snacks, which digs into different topics related to data and analytics. Here’s an example of one of our episodes.\n",
      "4. Explainer Videos\n",
      "Explainer videos do what’s on the tin — they explain a topic. These videos break a subject down to its bare components. They familiarize your viewers with subjects related to your industry, brand, and product.\n",
      "Sasha Matviienko of KGC Canada sees positive results from explainer and how-to videos. “ Every YouTube video we make is designed to give value to consumers. One of the favorite formats to give value is How To & Explainer videos. We first tried making these videos based on SEO research and noticed that for almost every product people are searching for the benefits & how to use them. So we trusted the data and never looked back,” Matviienko says.\n",
      "While this genre works well for top of funnel topics, you can make an explainer video as product- or brand-focused as you want. Shopify, for example, has an explainer video for its product.\n",
      "5. Product Reviews\n",
      "Product reviews involve evaluating a product’s quality and usefulness. These videos generally relate to products outside of your brand. So, you’ll see them often used for channels that specialize in reviewing products.\n",
      "When it’s appropriate for you to film a product review, this video format helps you build trust with viewers. The people who watch your video will see you as a source to come to when they need to make purchasing decisions.\n",
      "One of the most prominent sources for product reviews out there is the New York Times’ Wirecutter vertical. Its YouTube channel includes plenty of video reviews, including this video on wireless earbuds.\n",
      "6. Challenge Videos\n",
      "Challenge videos can have multiple angles. They can show you performing a viral challenge, presenting your team with a challenge, or putting out a challenge to your viewers.\n",
      "These videos are more community-focused and showcase your brand’s human side. They make a great opportunity to get viewers familiar with your team or interact with you.\n",
      "Some of the most popular examples of challenge videos from the past decade happened during the Ice Bucket Challenge trend. Brand professionals and regular users alike doused themselves in ice-cold water to raise money for medical research. Even The Muppets went in on the trend.\n",
      "7. Video Podcasts\n",
      "With podcasts trending in the content marketing world, it’s important to find ways to market them. Video podcasts present podcasts in a video format, often in the form of a recorded video call.\n",
      "Like their audio counterparts, video podcasts bring in new leads and offer opportunities to connect with other professionals in your industry.\n",
      "But, if you decide to publish your podcast as a video, you might benefit from a shorter format.\n",
      "Alex Birkett explains, “I’ll admit that we haven’t experimented with everything, but the videos that have done the worst are full, unedited podcast conversations. It might work for Tim Ferriss or others with big brand names, but not for us.”\n",
      "Birkett continues, “What works better is just a slight variation: 2-5 minute clips from the full conversation. We clip off passionate rants, contrarian opinions, or tutorial walkthroughs and give it a specific title that maps to a YouTube keyword that has some search volume. These quick clips can also be used as YouTube shorts if they’re short enough. These have done MUCH better than the full interviews.”\n",
      "To give you a better idea of what Birkett means, here’s one of Omniscient Digital’s podcast clips. It’s ten minutes long compared to the hour-long audio version.\n",
      "8. Behind-the-Scenes (BTS) Videos\n",
      "Behind-the-scenes (BTS) videos show what happens at your organization. They can show off your day-to-day, highlight a staff member’s work, or showcase your company culture.\n",
      "BTS videos humanize your brand and connect the viewer to your team. If you work in a niche industry that the typical person doesn’t know about, they can also be enlightening for your customers.\n",
      "CoSchedule shares a lot of BTS content on its social media and YouTube channel. Its video on making meaningful graphics combines the BTS format with the educational genre by having CoSchedule’s graphic designer explain her approach.\n",
      "9. Product Launch Videos\n",
      "Product launch videos announce your release of a new product or feature. This format capitalizes on YouTube’s social media capabilities. Viewers who get their news from YouTube as a social media channel will learn about the newest updates from your organization.\n",
      "Plus, if you have an interactive product like software, video also helps you describe your product in ways you can’t through text or images alone.\n",
      "At Databox, we used YouTube as a channel to update our subscribers on our recently released custom reports feature. Our video showcases the feature as it works in our interface.\n",
      "10. Product Demo Videos\n",
      "Product demo videos demonstrate how your product works or how to use your product. Because of this dual purpose, they can come in the form of showcases or informational videos.\n",
      "Video allows you to show off your product’s details and answer common questions about using it. Many people learn best by watching someone do something, so a product demo video can help them truly understand what you have to offer.\n",
      "This video’s a little grainy, but it’s one of my favorite examples of a product demo to share. It shows you how to use the AeroKat chamber to give a cat an inhaler.\n",
      "11. Funny Videos\n",
      "Funny videos have the goal of entertaining the viewer. Many have the sole purpose of being funny, but they can also be educational or advertise your product.\n",
      "Videos focused on humor have great share potential when you pull off that humor well. They also build trust with customers who are skeptical of brands that focus entirely on product-focused content.\n",
      "Kizik’s Monte Deere says, “For our hands-free shoe company, our best-performing video by literally millions of views demonstrated the product through the framework of a comedy sketch. They say that the shorter the better, but this video clocked in at two and a half minutes.”\n",
      "Deere explains, “To show off the advantages and utility of a completely hands-free shoe, we told the story of a man who can’t wrap his mind around not using his hands to put his shoes on. Investigators interrogate him and slap him every time he tries to use his hands, but really just wanted the opportunity to try the shoes for themselves. It proved our most shareable on Facebook and upped our subscriber numbers, further solidifying our brand identity and our approach to future marketing campaigns.”\n",
      "Chris Castanes from Surf Financial Brokers saw a similar trend. “Our channel is all about life and health insurance products, which can be boring. With that in mind we have a few humorous videos, like “Can Zombies Get Life Insurance?”, which have gotten some good feedback. Our most watched video is a YouTube short with a cat in a hammock. I actually had someone call for life insurance after that one,” Castanes tells us.\n",
      "One recent example of humor from a prominent  business is AAA Insurance’s take on Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”\n",
      "12. Short Videos\n",
      "With short videos’ rise in popularity due to platforms like TikTok, marketers now pay more attention to shorter video lengths. Many organizations see higher performance from shorter videos in their data.\n",
      "“Hands down, the videos that perform the best on our channel are the shortest ones,” says Clearsurance.com’s Vickie Pierre. “There’s no question that we’re in a generation of consumers whose attention span only seems to get smaller and smaller. And data backs that up. Most people don’t view videos in their entirety. Rather, they stick around long enough to decide whether they want to even stick around.”\n",
      "Pierre adds, “As a result, we have found our shortest videos have the best performance, and the best return on investment. They may not necessarily have the highest number of views, but our analytics reveal that people will watch most, if not all, of our shorter videos. For us, this is a success because that means they’re receiving the entire message — not just a portion of it. In the end, this gives us a greater opportunity to make a true, meaningful connection with our viewers.”\n",
      "YouTube’s YouTube Shorts format could work well if you plan on following this trend. Since they fall into the short video genre, though, consider comparing your Shorts performance to your data for TikTok and Instagram Shorts.\n",
      "Red Bull has released quite a few short videos in 2022. Here’s one that covers a similar subject to its longer videos on amazing physical feats.\n",
      "PRO TIP: Analyze Your YouTube Channel Performance Like a Pro\n",
      "To find out what types of video content perform best with your audience, you may track video engagement metrics such as watch time, number of views, likes and dislikes of each video individually using a variety of tools, including YouTube itself. \n",
      "Now you can quickly monitor your video content performance in a single dashboard that monitors fundamental metrics, such as:\n",
      "Average watch time. How much time do viewers spend watching your video content?\n",
      "Watch time by video. Which videos drive most of your audience watch time each month?\n",
      "Subscribers gained vs lost. How quickly are you gaining or losing subscribers?\n",
      "Number of likes, comments and shares. How engaged is your audience?\n",
      "Now you can benefit from the experience of our video marketing experts, who have put together a plug-and-play Databox template showing the most important metrics for measuring your YouTube channel performance. It’s simple to implement and start using as a standalone dashboard or in marketing reports, and best of all, it’s free!\n",
      "You can easily set it up in just a few clicks – no coding required.\n",
      "To set up the dashboard, follow these 3 simple steps:\n",
      "Step 1: Get the template \n",
      "Step 2: Connect your YouTube account with Databox. \n",
      "Step 3: Watch your dashboard populate in seconds.\n",
      "Get the template free\n",
      "13. Q&A Videos\n",
      "Question and answer (Q&A) videos work similarly to AMA videos, except they tend to have a predetermined list of questions. Instead of the audience asking questions, someone from the YouTube channel talks to the subject expert.\n",
      "This video format gives you the chance to network with subject matter experts in your field and build authority with your audience. Since Q&A videos have existing questions, you don’t need a large audience to get the conversation going.\n",
      "You can also combine the Q&A and AMA format by asking someone questions on stream and leaving room for audience questions. Optimist uses this approach all the time with its Q&A videos, such as in this interview with Tim Soulo.\n",
      "14. Community-Based Videos\n",
      "Community-based videos can use one of two approaches to connect your brand to your community. They can bring together community-submitted clips, or you can engage with your community yourself.\n",
      "When we asked marketing experts about the best ways to improve YouTube clickthrough rate (CTR), one solution mentioned was to build a community. Community-based videos give you the chance to do just that.\n",
      "MailChimp reaches out to the entrepreneur and creator communities as a whole to create original videos profiling their work. Note how this interview with Brightland’s founder hardly mentions MailChimp at all. Instead, it focuses on her story.\n",
      "15. Collaborations With Other Brands and Influencers\n",
      "In collaboration videos with other brands, you partner with another brand to create content for your audience. You can collab with a business in an adjacent industry or work with an organization in a totally different field. Depending on your product, you could also work with an influencer your audience follows.\n",
      "When you create a collaboration video, you expose your brand to two groups of people — your audience and your partner’s audience. This approach gives your content more reach and lets you connect with businesses with similar goals.\n",
      "MediaPeanut’s Sofia Morales has plenty of experience helping brands create YouTube content. Currently, collaboration videos perform well. “The most effective video content that we have launched so far are the personal video blogs where we invite and collaborate with YouTube influencers to try on some other client’s products as well as in visiting/interviewing the product owners, place, or service that we are trying to promote via produced and curated videos,” Morales says.\n",
      "Morales has also found success with funny videos, challenges, and food reviews. “What makes these different is its unique presentation despite some brands not being open to adopt these strategies despite its effectiveness in getting more product awareness and engagements from the audience,” Morales explains.\n",
      "One big brand example of a YouTube collaboration is Buzzfeed and Purina’s video short about a man and his puppy.\n",

      "In an era where social media reigns supreme and short-form video has emerged as the king of content, Food & Beverage brands must adapt, innovate, and embrace new strategies to remain relevant and successful. TikTok, which boasts an astounding 26.5 billion views under #TikTokFood, serves as a testament to this shift, demonstrating the vast appetite for food content, not merely for entertainment but as a powerful catalyst for purchase decisions. ‍As a food & beverage brand, you are competing in one of the top five categories on most social media platforms, especially in the realm of short-form video. This digital transformation presents an unprecedented opportunity to tap into the pulse of your audience and promote your brand in ways that were once unimaginable.‍This article will delve into three of the most compelling strategies for your brand to thrive in the social media landscape: brand-owned user-generated content (UGC), paid social video ads, and influencer marketing, with a particular focus on micro-influencers. Each strategy comes with its own set of advantages and challenges, from the organic reach of UGC and the wide net cast by paid ads to the higher click-through rates of micro-influencers.‍Understanding and leveraging these strategies is no longer optional; it's the cornerstone of success in today's digital-first world.  But how can you discern which strategy is right for your brand? We will explore this critical question, equipping you with the tools to navigate this new era of food marketing. Social media and its video-first platforms have transformed the marketing landscape entirely, making it the indispensable platform for promoting your food & beverage brand effectively.‍Example of a UGC Food Video On TikTok.1. Brand Owned/Licensed User Generated Content (UGC)‍Brand owned or licensed UGC is a marketing strategy where a brand creates, or commissions the creation of, user-generated content and shares it on its own social media channels. Within the context of short-form video marketing platforms such as Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok, this approach offers a blend of authenticity and control. It allows brands to leverage the relatability and engagement of UGC while maintaining their brand narrative, tone, and aesthetics across various platforms.‍Tips for Executing an Effective UGC Strategy‍1. Identify Your Target Audiences‍Understanding your product's potential and its benefits is crucial. For instance, consider a protein-packed, dairy-free, organic snack. This product can cater to various target audiences: health enthusiasts keen on a Whole 30 diet, vegans who are dairy-free by choice, fitness buffs counting their macros, or food artisans who appreciate organic ingredients. Align your product positioning with the needs and preferences of these audiences to optimize your brand's appeal.‍2. Choose Your Video Platforms Strategically‍While maximizing reach across all short-form video platforms is beneficial, identifying the most effective platform for your content will drive engagement. Instagram is ideal for visually appealing content, TikTok is perfect for storytelling and immersive experiences, YouTube Shorts favors ASMR content, and Facebook's short-form videos tend to reach a slightly older demographic. ‍3. Embrace DIY Video Content Creation on a Budget‍If you're a startup with a tight budget, consider creating UGC yourself. Maintain a regular content creation schedule, similar to a blog, aiming to post at least once a day. This hands-on approach offers valuable insights into your brand's content performance. Alternatively, if your budget allows, use platforms like Crafted to create high-performing food videos.‍4. TikTok & Instagram Reels is a Volume Game‍UGC is all about consistency. The viewership of your videos will vary, with most garnering low thousands of views, periodically hitting tens of thousands, and occasionally, hundreds of thousands. Begin with a manageable content creation pace, say, three videos a week, gradually increasing the frequency to multiple times daily.‍5. Use TikTok & Instagram Reels Trends Wisely‍Engage with popular trends and sounds, but ensure they align with your brand. Vanity views from trend followers may not convert into valuable customers if they don't align with your brand's niche.‍6. Test and Iterate‍Regularly evaluate and optimize your content strategy. Aim to discover which video formats and unique selling points resonate with each target audience. Develop a systematic approach for testing to ensure time and resources aren't wasted on low-performing videos.‍Pros of UGCCost-Effectiveness: With platforms like Crafted, you can produce high-performing UGC videos for as little as $200, making it a cost-effective strategy when executed correctly.Audience Ownership: Brand-owned UGC allows you to build and retain your audience. You control elements like link-in-bio, captions, CTAs, and can engage with your audience multiple times, taking advantage of first-touch/last-touch marketing, which refers to the first and last interaction a customer has with your brand before making a purchase.Data Ownership: With brand-owned UGC, you own your data, providing insights into your content performance and audience demographics.‍Cons of UGCTime-Consuming: Creating UGC can be time-consuming if done in-house. Outsourcing to UGC providers like Crafted can alleviate this burden.Limited Reach: Brand-owned UGC targets a specific niche audience associated with your profile, offering less exposure than paid ads and influencers which have wider reach.‍‍Screenshot of the Video Ad Experience on TikTok.2. Video Ads on Social Media‍Video ads on social media, particularly on platforms like TikTok, offer a cost-effective avenue for marketers, given their lower CPMs (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) compared to saturated platforms like Facebook Ads. This benefit comes with a catch: the necessity for high-performing video content, which presents a barrier to entry. Therefore, brands must invest in compelling, engaging video content to make the most of the ad space and capture audience attention effectively.‍Tips for Deploying Video Ad Creative on Paid Social Channels‍1. Blend In with the Platform‍Video ads should be designed to blend seamlessly with the platform's regular content, making them less intrusive and more engaging. Each platform has a unique style: Instagram prefers aesthetic and branded visuals, while TikTok leans towards raw, user-generated content. Disregarding this distinction can make your ads stand out negatively, resulting in lower engagement.‍2. Capture Attention with a Hook‍With 91% of ads going unnoticed, it's crucial to grab attention immediately. Employ an intriguing hook, such as a tantalizing shot of a finished dish, an appealing personality, an emotive story, a surprising scene, or an intriguing title. This arresting start will prevent users from scrolling past your video.‍3. Test Your Ad Creative‍Before scaling up your ad spend, test different creatives with varying messages or unique selling points across diverse audiences. For example, a plant-based vegan nugget brand could target different audiences: health-conscious parents, children who appreciate fun shapes, busy parents valuing quick meal prep, budget-conscious families, or vegans seeking quality meat alternatives. Focus on different segments of the ad creative, the ad copy, and the ending CTA. Use platforms like Crafted to produce video content that you can quickly test. Consider testing slight price promotions as well.‍4. Prioritize Data and Targeting‍Utilize platforms with robust advertising capabilities to ensure accurate targeting and data analysis. Be cautious about spending excessively on platforms with underdeveloped advertising capacities, like YouTube Shorts.‍Pros of Video Ad CreativeGuaranteed Reach: Unlike UGC or influencer strategies, video ads offer guaranteed reach, ensuring your content is seen by a specific number of users.Hyperlink Capability: Video ads allow you to add hyperlinks, leading viewers deeper into your sales funnel. This capability is limited or non-existent in non-ad posts.Precise Targeting: Video ads on social media provide advanced targeting options, enabling more accurate testing across different demographics and audiences.‍Cons of Video Ad CreativeCostly: Video ads require both content creation and promotional costs. These expenses can accumulate, especially if the content needs to be high-quality to stand out.Lower Engagement: Ads are often noticed and skipped by users, leading to lower engagement compared to organic content. It's crucial to balance ad content with regular posts to maintain audience interest and engagement.‍3. Influencer Marketing‍Influencer marketing involves partnering with individuals who have an established online presence and audience to promote your brand. In this context, we focus on micro-influencers, those with a relatively smaller but highly engaged following. Micro-influencers are often more cost-effective, bring a diversified audience, and their use reduces the risk of marketing failure due to their varied audience demographics.‍Tips for Influencer Marketing‍1. Check Engagement Rates and Quality of Content‍When sourcing micro-influencers, it's important to check their engagement rates and the quality of their content. A good engagement rate ranges from 1-5%. You can source micro-influencers manually on social media, use influencer marketing platforms, or use services like Crafted. Remember, quality often correlates with cost.‍2. Target Relevant Audiences‍Ensure the micro-influencers you partner with have a follower base that aligns with your target demographics. This strategy allows you to test different selling points with different audiences. Finding micro-influencers in each of your target audiences and tracking the results can provide insights into which benefits resonate most with each group.‍3. Track Individual Performance‍Tracking the performance of each micro-influencer is crucial to identify those who yield the best results, so you can find more influencers with similar profiles. This tracking is relatively straightforward for online brands using tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, GTM links, and unique promo codes. For brands converting online viewers to retail store visits, it's trickier, and you may need to rely on upper funnel metrics like views and engagement.‍4. Provide Guidelines but Allow Authenticity‍While it's acceptable to offer general guidelines and talking points to micro-influencers, it's crucial not to over-direct. Micro-influencers know their audience well and how to engage them authentically. Too much direction can make the content feel scripted and less genuine, undermining the authenticity that is key to influencer marketing success.‍Pros of Influencer MarketingTesting Niches: Influencer marketing enables you to test different niche audiences with influencers who are already embedded in those communities and have earned their trust.Guaranteed Viewership: The success of a post is not solely reliant on algorithms, as influencers have a set of followers who interact with their content first, providing early engagement signals to the algorithm.High Engagement: Micro-influencer posts can garner higher levels of engagement than paid ads or brand-owned UGC, especially for newer accounts still building a following.‍Cons of Influencer MarketingTime-Consuming: Sourcing high-quality micro-influencers is time-consuming and requires constant cycling to reach new audiences. However, platforms like Crafted can ease this process with their pre-vetted network of high-performing food-focused micro-influencers.Negotiation Challenges: Pricing negotiations with micro-influencers can be difficult as their listed prices might not align with the actual value or ROI they provide. Services like Crafted handle this negotiation, working within your budget to identify and negotiate with influencers.Expensive: If done manually and without successful negotiation, influencer marketing can be an expensive advertising strategy.Potential Misses: Not all influencers will be a hit, even with pre-vetting. A volume strategy can help mitigate this risk, ensuring that successful influencers balance out those that underperform.‍Screenshot of the Analytics Panel on the TikTok App.Experimenting to Determine the Right Strategy for Your Brand‍Determining the most effective social media strategy for your brand, whether it's influencer marketing, video ads on social platforms, or brand-owned user-generated content (UGC), often requires experimentation. If your resources permit, testing each channel with a small budget can provide valuable insights into what works best for your brand.‍With brand-owned UGC, your initial content may not perform as expected. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate a failed strategy. It's common to encounter a learning curve while figuring out what resonates with your audience. To navigate this, consider producing about 10-15 UGC videos. Platforms like Crafted, specifically designed for food and beverage brands, can expedite this process and offer excellent video performance in terms of viewership and engagement.‍For video ads on platforms like TikTok, consider setting aside a budget of $1-2K for your initial campaign. This budget should include the cost of content production. Remember, producing high-quality video content is a critical component of success on these platforms.‍When it comes to micro-influencers, a trial budget of $4K can be a good starting point. Again, platforms like Crafted can help you source high-performing micro-influencers efficiently, saving you time and resources.‍However, if resources are constrained, it's crucial to be strategic in your testing. While cost-cutting might be necessary, it's important not to compromise the effectiveness of your tests. Instead, consider focusing on one or two channels that you believe will be most effective for your brand.‍When evaluating the performance of these channels, focus on metrics such as views, engagement rates, and the return on investment (ROI). The return on time invested is another important factor to consider. The ability to produce effective content quickly can significantly impact your marketing efforts. Additionally, look at metrics further down the funnel, such as sales. This metric is easier to track for e-commerce brands, but brick-and-mortar brands can also find ways to measure this.‍Experimentation is key to determining the right social media strategy for your brand. With a thoughtful approach and the right tools, you can uncover the most effective methods to connect with your target audience.‍SummaryIn the digital age, a strategic and informed approach to social media can significantly boost brand recognition and customer engagement. Whether through UGC, video ads, or influencer marketing, finding the right strategy for marketing your brand is key. Remember to experiment, iterate, and above all, stay true to your brand's unique identity. Your audience is out there, waiting to connect with your brand; it's just a matter of discovering the most effective way to engage them.‍This article provides a comprehensive guide to harnessing the power of social media for brand promotion, focusing on three key strategies: brand-owned user-generated content, video ads, and influencer marketing. It offers practical tips for each approach, explaining how to align product positioning with target audiences, select suitable social media platforms, and effectively use micro-influencers. However, as each brand is unique, it's crucial to experiment with these strategies to identify which resonates most with your audience.‍‍Posted May 22, 2023 in Social Media categoryTodd BaldwinView PostsTags:Short-Form VideoInstagramMicro-InfluencersSocial MediaTikTokMarketingDownload the Ultimate Guide to Influencer Marketing‍Get insider tips and strategies from Crafted to boost your brand's influence.

      "Major Market Drivers: Key drivers influencing the market growth include the growing popularity of ethnic cuisines, health and wellness trends, increasing interest in culinary exploration and diverse flavors, growing fast food and food service industries, and the rising influence of social media and food blogging.\n",
      "Key Market Trends: The key market trends involve an ongoing shift towards natural and organic hot sauces, responding to health-conscious consumers.

However, the emerging health and wellness trends, expansion into emerging markets, and adoption of e-commerce and digital marketing are creating new opportunities for the market growth.\n",
      "Hot Sauce Market Trends:\n",
      "The Increasing Cultural Diversity and Culinary Exploration \n",
      "The hot sauce industry overview is significantly influenced by the increasing cultural diversity and culinary exploration among consumers. People are more exposed than ever to different cultures and cuisines, leading to heightened curiosity and willingness to experiment with new flavors. Hot sauce, with its myriad of flavors and origins, such as Mexican salsas and fiery Thai sauces, represents a symbol of this culinary exploration. It is not only utilized in restaurants but also in home cooking, where individuals are increasingly trying their hands on recreating global dishes. For example, the U.S. has the largest Mexican population, which is followed by India and China. The evolving dietary patterns of individuals are catalyzing the demand for ethnic and regional cuisines. This, in turn, will bolster the sales of innovative product variants, including cayenne pepper sauce, in the United States. In line with this, the rising penetration of the internet and the inflating popularity of social media platforms are elevating the usage of hot sauce and positively impacting the food choices of consumers, especially among millennials. For instance, according to the Ministry of Finance of Japan, in 2020, the export volume of sauce mixtures from Japan was amounted to around 66.4 million kilograms.\n",
      "Rising Popularity of Ethnic Cuisines\n",
      "The rising popularity of ethnic cuisines, particularly across Latin America, the Caribbean, and parts of Asia, which are known for their spicy flavors, is propelling the hot sauce market business opportunity. These cuisines often feature hot sauce as a staple condiment, integral to the authenticity of their flavors. Furthermore, the increasing number of ethnic restaurants and food trucks in major cities across the world is acting as another growth-inducing factor. Furthermore, people are becoming more adventurous with their food choices, which is facilitating the demand for ethnic cuisines and, by extension, hot sauces. For instance, consumers across the globe are widely inclining towards gourmet cuisines. Consequently, according to hot sauce industry statistics, new major players are expected to gain significant opportunities by creating a wide array of product varieties. For example, in January 2024, TRUFF, a global hot sauce and condiments company, introduced the TRUFF Jalapeno Lime Hot Sauce. Besides this, supermarkets and grocery stores have expanded their international food sections, making ingredients like hot sauce more accessible to the home cook. For instance, sriracha sauce, along with barbeque sauces and other hot sauces, are widely available via grocers. This easy accessibility of variants, including sriracha, makes it widely popular as an ingredient beyond Asian cuisine. Moreover, the rising travel and tourism activity, coupled with the growing impact of social media, which is playing a significant role in familiarizing people with various ethnic cuisines, is supporting the market growth. For instance, Chiara Ferragni (C.F.), the founder of theblondesalad.com, a fashion blog that has turned into a global retail business with 24 million followers on Instagram, developed a model of open innovation (OI) available to small and medium-sized companies operating in the Ho.Re.Ca. and enogastronomy sector for advertising activities.\n",
      "Emerging Health and Wellness Trends\n",
      "Modern consumers are increasingly becoming conscious of their dietary choices and are seeking products that offer health benefits without compromising on flavor. In line with this, hot sauces made with natural ingredients like chili peppers, garlic, and vinegar align well with this health-oriented approach. Furthermore, they are known for their health benefits, including pain relief, weight loss support, and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, many hot sauces are low in calories and free from artificial additives, aligning with the growing demand for clean-label products. Furthermore, the shifting trends toward home cooking, where individuals have more control over the ingredients they use, are boosting the market growth. Moreover, the rise of plant-based diets, which incorporate hot sauces to add flavor to vegetable-based dishes, is bolstering the market growth. For instance, in 2021, Veeba introduced certified organic dips under the Earth-made Organix label. In addition, in May 2021, Ujjo launched a variant that can be specifically used in coffee. Commonly available in two flavors and made from natural ingredients, it offers a wide array of health benefits, owing to antioxidants. As a result, this variant of spicy sauce gained extensive traction in many international cuisines. \n",
      "Recent Innovations in Flavors and Varieties\n",
      "Hot sauce industry top brands are constantly experimenting and introducing new flavors to meet the evolving tastes and preferences of consumers. For instance, in February 2022, McCormick & Co. collaborated with Campbell Soup Co.'s Goldfish brand, to re-launch Goldfish Frank's Red-Hot crackers. In line with this, the integration of fruits, such as mango, pineapple, and raspberry in hot sauces, catering to a segment of consumers looking for a blend of sweet and spicy flavors, is boosting the market growth. For example, given that apple pomace contains approximately 84.7% carbohydrate, 5.6% starch, and 54.2% total sugar, it could also be used as flavorings, which is bolstering the market growth. Additionally, the use of various types of peppers, herbs, and spices, leading to a proliferation of distinct and regional hot sauce flavors, is positively influencing the market growth. Moreover, the increasing trend towards gourmet and artisanal hot sauces that emphasize quality, locality, and traditional production methods, is contributing to the market growth. Besides this, continuous experiments with aging processes, fermentation, and unusual ingredient combinations, adding depth and complexity to the flavors, are positively influencing the hot sauce market outlook.\n",
      "Growing Fast Food and Food Service Industries\n",
      "The expansion of the fast food and food service industries is a significant factor contributing to the market growth. Fast food chains and restaurants across the globe are increasingly incorporating spicy items into their menus, responding to consumer demand for more flavorful and diverse food options. Hot sauce is an integral component in many spicy offerings, used either as an ingredient in food preparation or as a condiment offered alongside meals. Furthermore, the emerging trend of customizable meals in fast food and casual dining restaurants, allowing consumers to tailor the spice level of their food, often through a selection of hot sauces, is catalyzing the market growth. Additionally, the significant growth of food delivery services, which has made a wide range of culinary options, including spicy dishes, more accessible to consumers, is strengthening the market growth. For example, Chinese food is quite popular in India, and the use of soy sauce and mustard sauce is quite common in Chinese food. Similarly, in other countries like China and Japan ethnic food like Mexican, and Italian are gaining popularity This, in turn, is bolstering the demand for these sauces across the globe.\n",

According to the report, cooking sauce accounted for the largest market share. The cooking sauce segment is dominating the market as it includes hot sauces primarily used as an ingredient in the cooking process. They are integral to a variety of cuisines, imparting flavor, spice, and depth to dishes during preparation. Cooking sauces are versatile and can be found in a range of recipes, such as marinades, stews, stir-fries, and soups. They are particularly popular in ethnic cuisines where spicy flavors are a cornerstone, such as in Mexican, Caribbean, and various Asian foods. Furthermore, the emerging trend of consumers seeking more authentic and artisanal food experiences is boosting the market growth. For instance, Mexican and Asian-inspired cooking sauces are gaining traction in the United States.\n",
      "End-Use Insights:\n",
      "Commercial\n",
      "Household\n",
      "The report has provided a detailed breakup and analysis of the market based on the end-use. This includes commercial and household. According to the report, commercial represented the largest segment. The commercial segment is dominating the market as hot sauce is widely used in restaurants, fast food chains, food service providers, and other hospitality-related businesses, as cooking ingredients and as table condiments. Furthermore, the increasing incorporation of spicy and ethnic foods in restaurant menus, reflecting the evolving tastes of consumers who are seeking more diverse and flavorful dining experiences, is boosting the market growth.
